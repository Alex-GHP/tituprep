// This file is kept for backward compatibility but the app now uses:
// - Supabase Auth (lib/supabase/auth-provider.tsx) for authentication
// - Next.js App Router for page navigation
// - Server components for data fetching
// - Server actions (lib/actions.ts) for mutations

// The old AppProvider/useApp pattern is no longer used.
// This file can be safely deleted once all references are removed.
